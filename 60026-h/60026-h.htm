<p class="smaller">“It is the completest statement of the case for the democratic control
of foreign affairs which has been published, and contains a mass of facts
whose value cannot be exaggerated. We owe Mr. Ponsonby a great
debt for this work.”—<cite>Labour Leader.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“... Mr. Ponsonby’s main contention is one which may and should
receive the hearty assent of many who disagree with him in detail. He
strongly urges the necessity in dealing with foreign affairs of ensuring
the co-operation and approval of the great mass of the people. He is
manifestly quite right.”—The late <span class="smcap">Lord Cromer</span> in The <cite>Spectator</cite>.</p>

<p class="smaller">“Mr. and Mrs. Ponsonby’s book is intended for children or for those who
are too busy to read books in many volumes. But the interest of it lies
not in the necessarily short and simple narratives giving the story rather
than the ideas, although these are done clearly and with spirit, but in the
reflections which lie about those stories and lodge here and there in the
reader’s mind. Like all books worth reading this one is the outcome of a
mass of judgments and beliefs which may be very briefly expressed in the
work itself, but lend it the gift which in the case of human beings we call
personality.”—<cite>The Times Literary Supplement.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“The story of these twelve lives is told in these pages—and told with
a most enticing simplicity and the happiest taste—in the hope of redressing
the balance between men of action and men of thought, and of showing
that this type of character and achievement can be made just as interesting
to the young as the more conventional hero of the history book....
This book is more especially for the young, but it will be a delight also to
grown-up readers.”—<cite>The Nation.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“The biographies are always well simplified and written in a clear and
pointed way. They are accompanied by portraits, which add not a little
to the work’s attractiveness as a book unusually well fitted to the needs
of young readers who are beginning to take an interest in history.”—<cite>The
Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">A growing</span> number of people are devoting their attention
to a closer study of foreign affairs. Many of them may
not have the opportunity to read the larger volumes of
histories; and, indeed, even if they had, they would find
their choice of books very much restricted when they
came to the more recent period of European and world
history, although in the last year or so the gap has to some
extent been filled up by several interesting studies of international
politics in the nineteenth century. Some knowledge
of this period is essential if we are to understand
the full significance of the events of to-day, and if we are
to form any helpful opinion of the course to be pursued
in future.</p>

<p>Historians often take for granted that their readers
already have some general knowledge of the groundwork
of events and they build up their structure of criticism,
their delineation of policy and tendencies, and their survey
of international problems on the assumption that the
scaffolding has been erected. But often it has not, and
then history, more especially the complex tangle of international
history, becomes difficult to grasp. It may
therefore serve some useful purpose if a few poles of scaffolding
representing the dates and outline of conflicts
and agreements between nations can be supplied in a very
brief and easily intelligible form, a presentment of the
bare record of facts which may be useful for reference.</p>

<p>During the last hundred years war has been a more
common occurrence in international intercourse than most
people realize. The forty-two records of wars tabled in
these pages do not cover the whole ground. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the chief conflicts, or the conflicts fraught with the most
serious consequences, but they are by no means the
only occasions on which there was fighting in the world.
Revolutions, unless they led to international war, are
not mentioned, neither are expeditions such as the advance
on Llassa, the Chitral expedition, the Indian frontier wars,
the Kaffir wars, the Somaliland expeditions, the revolt of
the Herreroes in German West Africa or the French
expeditions in Morocco: the wars between the states
of South America, with two exceptions, have also been
omitted. But the list as it stands, is striking enough and
may suffice to make the student inquire further into the
circumstances which produced this almost unceasing strife.</p>

<p>The causes are epitomized in the fewest possible words
and the occasion is separated from the cause. Causes
of wars are very seldom remembered and are not very
easily discovered in the perusal of histories. The occasion
is sometimes mistaken for the cause, whereas it may often
be merely a pretext. The occasion of a war has not infrequently
been a comparatively trivial incident, whereas
the cause can be traced to the gradual development of
friction for which divergence of policies or conflict of ambitions
may have been responsible. The trivial incident,
or even an incident of a more serious nature, may pass off
without fatal consequences if no friction exists between
the nations and there is a general atmosphere of amicable
understanding. Where, on the contrary, relations are
strained it requires but a very small spark to light up a
conflagration. It is important therefore to detach the
occasion from the cause.</p>

<p>Causes of war in the nineteenth century differ to some
extent from those of previous centuries. The elemental
combative passion of man expressing itself in fierce racial
animosities is far less noticeable. Religious differences
do not figure so positively as a reason for conflict.
Dynastic ambitions linger on and still play a formidable
part, even after 1815, but not with the same unashamed
and aggressive arrogance as in bygone centuries. Nationalist
aspirations begin to assert themselves, and the waves
of revolutionary exasperation with outworn systems of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
despotic government have made those very governments
combat that spirit by force of arms. As the century proceeds,
and the wonderful inventions for rapid transit and
communication develop, the most noticeable element in
war-making is the commercial or colonial ambition of
governments fostered largely by the pressure of financial
interests and declaring itself under the name of Empire.
This policy of competitive imperial expansion in the newly
accessible regions of the globe will be found to constitute
the most frequent cause of dispute, of jealousy, and of
suspicion between nations. The pretext will vary, the
excuse will be presented under plausible guises for popular
consumption, but the ultimate cause, the fundamental
origin will be the same. Imperialism economic in its
origin is fostered largely by an exaggerated spirit of nationalism.</p>

<p>The remarkable extent of Empire expansion in the
latter part of the nineteenth century is best illustrated
by the following <span class="locked">figures:—</span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Acquisitions of Territory</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the British Empire 1870–1900: 4,754,000 square
miles; 88,000,000 population.</p>

<p>To France 1884–1900: 3,583,580 square miles;
36,553,000 population.</p>

<p>To Germany 1884–1900: 1,026,220 square miles;
16,687,100 population.</p></blockquote>

<p>But perhaps the chief and most frequent cause of war
is war itself. In the Balkan Peninsula—where, whenever
the fighting has ceased, nothing approaching a satisfactory
settlement has ever been concluded—this is specially true.
Eight or nine of the wars recorded concern the Balkans.
Or take the Crimean War. Sir Spencer Walpole says:</p>

<p>“From 1856 to 1878 the Continent of Europe was afflicted
with five great wars—the Franco-Austrian War of 1859;
the Danish of 1864; the Austro-Prussian of 1860; the
Franco-German of 1870 and the Russo-Turkish of 1878:
all of which can be lineally traced to the war of 1854,”
and one at least of those wars, as we know, sowed the
seeds of future war. The war that is concluded by a dictated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
peace, the war that leaves a sense of grievance and
unsatisfied though legitimate claims, the war that inspires
a lasting desire for revenge inevitably leads to future war.
Wars are never aggressive but always defensive on the
part of those who are responsible for waging them. Wars
are never defensive but always aggressive on the part
of those against whom they are waged. The Ministers
and monarchs do the quarrelling, the people believe the
version they are told and obey. The people do the fighting
and make the sacrifice, the Ministers and monarchs do
the treaty-making without consulting them. The people’s
part is one of valiance, endurance, and suffering; the part
of the Ministers and monarchs is one too often marred by
failure and frequently disfigured by intrigue and deception.</p>

<p>Cast your eye through these forty-two very brief records
of wars. Think of the valour, the determination, and
the heroism of the people, be they soldiers or civilians.
Consider the noble part played by those who without
question obeyed what they were led to believe was their
country’s call. And then look on the other side at the
results—the ineptitude of the statesmen, the patched-up
treaties, the worthless agreements, the wars that led to
further wars, the failure to secure a settlement after the
soldier had done his part, and the unnecessary prolongation
of conflicts when agreement might have been reached
by the exercise of a little wisdom and foresight. The
contrast is remarkable between the actions on the battlefield
and the intrigue in the council chamber. Blood
has been spilt, lives lost, and victories won often without
any positive advantage being gained in the final result.</p>

<p>The wars are arranged according to date. Some were
long-drawn-out struggles, others sharp conflicts of a few
months. The number of men engaged in any battle and
the casualties if they could be tabulated would no doubt
seem comparatively small to our modern eyes. The total
loss of life in the Crimean War amounted to about 600,000
men.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> An estimate of the loss in killed and wounded in
some of the other great battles may be given as follows:
Solferino (1859), 31,500; Chickamauga (1863), 35,100;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Gettysburg (1863), 37,000; Königrätz (1866), 26,894;
Vionville (1870), 32,800; Gravelotte (1870), 30,000; Plevna
(1877), 19,000;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The Boer War (1899–1902): British

</div>

<p>Wars to the generation that experiences them are unmixed
evils engendering hatred and evil passions and
bringing in their train loss, suffering, destruction, and
impoverishment, all of which are acutely felt. The succeeding
generation inherit their consequences in the shape
of high taxation and the attempts to mend and reconstruct
the dislocated national life. The horror has gone but
the memory remains. To the succeeding generation they
become episodes read of in the cold pages of history, and
then at last they fade into mere names—a battle with a
vaguely remembered date.</p>

<p>Each war is terminated by a treaty. The main provisions
of a few additional treaties which were not
concluded after wars are also given. In but few
instances have war treaties been observed, and in several
cases they were not worth the paper they were written
on. Treaties are signed and ratified by statesmen without
the sanction or approval, and sometimes without the
knowledge, of their people. The statesmen enter the
council chamber as individuals bent on securing advantages
at other people’s expense, and ready by bargain
and intrigue to attain their ends. These instruments
therefore are expressions of temporary expediency sometimes
exacted after defeat, sometimes the result of
compromise and generally inconclusive. If treaties are
to become sacred obligations founded on international
justice and respected not merely by changing governments
but by whole nations, the spirit in which they
are drawn up and the method by which they are
concluded must be radically altered. The existence of
secret treaties and engagements has proved to be one
of the gravest dangers to European peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
There are a large number of conventions which have
been concluded between nations, by which social intercourse
with regard to such matters as post and telegraph
is facilitated, and of late years arbitration treaties between
one Power and another have multiplied very rapidly. This
is the one advance in which the efforts of diplomacy have
borne fruit. The important treaty of Arbitration between
Great Britain and the United States is the only one of these
treaties mentioned in the list. Agreements with regard
to the conduct of war have been made, such as the Geneva
Convention of 1864 and 1906, and the Hague Declarations
of 1899 and 1907, but they have proved to a large extent
futile.</p>

<p>Treaties are generally concluded for an undefined period,
and lapse owing to deliberate breach or altered circumstances.
But no people, and it may safely be said no
government, was precisely aware which of the innumerable
treaties were still in force, and what actually in given
circumstances its obligations were.</p>

<p>There may be many instances in which a nation may
look back with pride at the victory of its arms and the
achievements of its generals. There are but few instances
in which a nation can look back with pride at the advantages
gained by treaties of peace and at the achievements
of its diplomatists. From the Treaty of Vienna, 1815, to
the Treaty of Bukarest, 1913, the record of so-called settlements
is not one to inspire confidence in the efficacy of
warfare or in the methods of diplomacy.</p>

<p>After the termination of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815
there were great hopes of an era of peace. But two antagonistic
elements existed in Europe which were bound
sooner or later to come into open conflict. On the one
hand the French Revolution had engendered in the peoples
a spirit of unrest, of discontent, of impatience with the
unfettered monarchical system, and at the same time confidence
in their power and hope of success in the destruction
of tyranny and arbitrary government. It was in fact the
rise of democracy. On the other side the despotic governments
were ready to co-operate, and, under the guidance
of Metternich, endeavour to repress and exterminate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
movement for the establishment of constitutional government,
and for the expression of nationalist and democratic
aspirations. Two waves of revolution passed over Europe
in 1830 and 1848, and by the middle of the century the
reactionaries could no longer hold their own, and many
states had been freed from despotism and oppression.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the century, however, as has already
been pointed out, fresh causes for war arose in the competitive
ambition of governments for imperial expansion.
Wars became more frequent and extended into remote
regions of the world which had become accessible. There
are forty-seven wars mentioned in these records; of these
thirteen took place before the Crimean War, which is
about the middle of the period, and thirty-three after. In
twenty-one out of the forty-five wars Great Britain was
either directly or indirectly concerned as a belligerent.
There were only two wars in which Christian nations were
not primarily involved.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in no country had the
peoples any voice in the determination of policy so far
as international affairs were concerned. While for brevity’s
sake the usual phraseology is adopted, and such expressions
used as “France decided,” “Russia refused,” “Italy
intended,” etc., etc., in no case does the name of the country
mean the people or indeed anything more than a monarch
and a few statesmen. Although constitutional monarchy
became established during the period in many countries,
and with it, parliamentary government, the idea of diplomacy,
foreign policy, international engagements, and
treaties being under parliamentary supervision and control,
had not yet been suggested.</p>

<p>The solution of the vast problem of the avoidance of
war in the future, if it rests alone on the wisdom of sovereigns
and statesmen, is not likely, judging by the experience
of the past, to be reached very rapidly. In the
meanwhile a careful examination of the events of recent
history is a necessary preparation for all who want to
dispel the strange but prevalent delusion that force of
arms settles international disputes, and this record may
be useful as a manual for reference.</p>

<h2 id="THE_GREEK_WAR">THE GREEK WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1821–1828</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Greece and later Russia, France and Great Britain.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Nationalist aspirations had been growing in Greece
ever since the French Revolution. These were encouraged
by an intellectual revival and commercial
development. The tyranny and cruel oppression of
Turkish misgovernment under Sultan Mahmud gradually
inflamed public opinion.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Hetæria Philike, a secret society, inaugurated
the rebellion. The first move was made in Moldavia,
where it completely failed. This was followed by a
revolt in the Morea and the islands of the Ægean
and subsequently in Central Greece.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>There were wholesale massacres on both sides,
notably the destruction by the Turks of the inhabitants
of Chios. The Turks were unable to suppress the
revolt. The Greeks under Kolokotrones exhausted
the Turkish army, and assistance was sought by the
Sultan from Mehemet Ali, of Egypt, who in 1823 conquered
Crete and defeated the Greeks at Psara. The
Egyptians and Turks entered Morea. Missolonghi
fell after a year’s siege, and the garrison in the Acropolis
at Athens surrendered in June 1827. By a
treaty signed at London in July 1827 Great Britain,
France, and Russia decided to intervene as mediators.
The Turks rejected mediation. The victory of the
allied fleets at Navarino took place on October 20 1827.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Adrianople</i>, September 1829 (see
also p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>) Greece became autonomous under the
supreme sovereignty of the Sultan. Shortly afterwards
the Powers agreed that Greece should be
established as an absolutely independent kingdom,
but without Crete or Samos, and with a frontier
line drawn from the mouth of the River Achelous to
a spot near Thermopylæ. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg
accepted the crown, but renounced it after
a few months. Prince Otho of Bavaria accepted
it in February 1833. After a revolution in 1862 he
was succeeded by Prince George of Denmark in 1863,
the father of King Constantine who was deposed in
1917.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Greece was confined within far too narrow limits,
with which she could not rest contented. The enmity
between Russia and Turkey was in no way mitigated,
and Russian ambitions remained unsatisfied.</p>

<h2 id="RUSSO-TURKISH_WAR">RUSSO-TURKISH WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1828–1829</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Russia.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>By the Treaty of London, July 1827, Great Britain,
Russia, and France undertook to put an end to the
conflict in the East, which had arisen out of the Greek
struggle for independence. After the victory of
Navarino, Canning died and Great Britain was inactive.
By the <i>Treaty of Akerman</i>, October 1826,
the points of contention between Russia and Turkey
had been settled in Russia’s favour. But the Russian
Government ardently desired a contest with Turkey.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Sultan Mahmud issued a proclamation which
was a direct challenge to Russia, and followed it by
a levy of troops and the expulsion of Christians from
Constantinople. On April 26, 1828, Russia replied
by declaring war.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Russians occupied the Roumanian principalities
and crossed the Danube. At first the Turks had
considerable successes in the Dobrudja, and the
Russians, who suffered enormous losses, were only
able to capture Varna. Reserves were brought up
during the winter. After fierce resistance the Turks
were routed near Shumla. In July 1829 the Russians
crossed the Balkans, the fleet co-operated in the Black
Sea, and the army began to march on Constantinople.
In Asia, Kars and Erzeroum having fallen into the
Russian hands, the Sultan yielded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Adrianople</i>, September 14, 1829,
Russian ascendancy in the principalities of the Danube
was permanently assured, and the whole of the Caucasus
was converted into Russian territory. The Straits
were declared free and open to merchant ships of all
Powers. The Turkish Government gave its adhesion
to the Treaty of London regulating the Greek frontier.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Russia’s hold over Turkey was greatly strengthened,
but the establishment of an absolutely independent
kingdom in Greece was finally secured.</p>

<h2 id="WAR_BETWEEN_HOLLAND_AND_BELGIUM">WAR BETWEEN HOLLAND AND BELGIUM<br />

<span class="subhead">1830–1839</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Holland.<br />
Belgium, France, Great Britain.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands was set up by
the Congress of Vienna in 1815, but from the first
there was discord between the two states of the
kingdom. King William was a Dutchman and a
Protestant. Holland, although the smaller of the two
states, had a permanent majority in the Chamber.
Public offices and appointments were filled by
Dutchmen. The hatred of Dutch rule grew, and with
it a desire for separation.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The success of the French Revolution of 1830 led
to an outbreak in Brussels, and Belgian insurgents
fought against the Dutch soldiers. The Powers met
in London, and Belgium was declared a separate
kingdom. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was offered the
crown and entered Brussels as King of the Belgians
on June 21, 1831; at the same time the Dutch prepared
for an invasion.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>On August 9, 1831, the Belgians were routed in
an encounter with the Dutch, but on the intervention
of the French army King William withdrew. The
Conference in London drew up a treaty, but King
William refused to come to terms and retained possession
of Antwerp. In November a combined British
and French fleet sailed for the coast of Holland, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
a French army laid siege to Antwerp. The Dutch
garrison capitulated on December 23, 1831, and the
town was handed over to the Belgians and the French
troops withdrew. Still the Dutch refused to yield
and held two forts which enabled them to command
the navigation of the Scheldt. Not till March 1838
did Holland signify her readiness to accept the treaty.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The Conference throughout had endeavoured to
come to an agreement; Austria, Prussia, and Russia
sympathized with Holland; but eventually the final
<i>Treaty of London</i> was signed on April 19, 1839. Luxemburg
was divided, and also the district of Maestricht.
The Scheldt was declared open to the commerce of
both countries. The national debt was divided, and
the five Powers guaranteed the independence and
neutrality of Belgium.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>As independent states the two countries lived side
by side amicably. The neutrality of Belgium was
reaffirmed in 1870 on the outbreak of the Franco-German
War.</p>

<p>Leopold was succeeded in 1865 by his son Leopold
II, under whose sovereignty the Congo Free State
was placed in 1885. King Albert succeeded his uncle
in 1909.</p>

<p class="bellig">

and for a period France and Great Britain.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Don Miguel, the head of the reactionary party, was
betrothed to Donna Maria, daughter of Pedro of
Brazil. In 1828, disregarding his professions of loyalty
to the Constitution, he declared himself King of
Portugal. The Constitutionalists, who were adherents
of Donna Maria, were crushed. She received no
assistance from outside to deal with the usurper.</p>

<p>In Spain Don Carlos, the King’s brother, was the
representative of the reactionary party. King
Ferdinand, before his death, issued the Pragmatic
Sanction, which enabled his daughter to succeed to
the throne. The King was weak and unpopular, and
Don Carlos had a great following in Spain.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1830 Great Britain and France demanded satisfaction
for the attacks on their subjects in Lisbon,
and their squadrons appeared in the Tagus. Great
Britain obtained an indemnity and an apology: the
French admiral carried off the best ships of Don
Miguel’s navy. In 1831 Pedro came over from Brazil
and raised troops for the reconquest of Portugal,
which began in the following year. Don Carlos
was making common cause with Don Miguel when
the King of Spain died in 1833, and his child Isabella
was declared Queen, with Christina, his wife, as Regent.
Rebellion broke out, and Don Carlos was proclaimed
King in several provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Don Pedro captured Oporto, but was besieged there
for nearly a year. With assistance from outside he
overcame the resistance of the enemy and entered
Lisbon in July, 1833. A quadruple treaty was signed
at London in April 1834, by which Spain and Portugal,
assisted by Great Britain and France, engaged to
drive both Miguel and Carlos from the Peninsula. A
Spanish army marched against Miguel and the British
fleet arrived. Miguel renounced the crown, and
quitted the Peninsula. Don Carlos was conducted
to London, but he escaped and appeared again in
Spain at the head of his insurgents in July 1834.
He gained several victories, and prepared to march
on Madrid. Christina appealed to France for assistance,
but Louis Philippe was reluctant to embark
on the enterprise and refused. The war continued
till at last General Espatero forced back the insurgents,
the Carlists turned their arms against one
another, and Don Carlos surrendered and crossed
the French frontier.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Absolutism was crushed and a more constitutional
form of government was established. But the throne
of Spain was the subject of further disputes in the
future.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This prolonged and barbaric conflict disgraced the
Spanish nation. The three Eastern Powers favoured
the cause of Don Carlos and reaction. It was the
fear of possibly provoking a general war that made
France refuse to intervene.</p>

<span class="subhead">1831</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Russia.<br />
Poland.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>By the three partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795
Poland ceased to exist as an independent state, and
Polish territory was divided up between Russia,
Prussia, and Austria. But in 1814 the Grand Duchy
of Warsaw was established as a separate kingdom
subject to the Czar of Russia. The economic and
political life was revived and with it antagonism to
Russia. In 1828 plans were made for an outbreak,
but the opportunity was neglected. The French
Revolution of 1830 rekindled the flames.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>A revolt broke out in November 1830. An attempt
was made to negotiate with the Czar Nicholas, who
let it be understood that Poland had but two alternatives,
unconditional submission or annihilation.
The Polish Government, in January 1831, replied by
proclaiming his dethronement. War was unavoidable,
and Russian troops crossed the Polish frontier
in February.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The losses sustained by the Russian armies were
considerable, but the Poles had to fall back on Warsaw
and were defeated at Ostrolenka. Russian reinforcements
came up, and on September 8, 1831, the Russian
army made its entrance into Warsaw, and the revolt
was suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The Constitution of Poland was abolished: it ceased
to be a separate kingdom and became a province of
the Russian Empire. The Polish leaders were exiled.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The Poles might have won a gradual development
of constitutional liberty without a break with the
powerful sovereignty of the Czar; the revolt no doubt
was rash and unwise. But, on the other hand, the
governments of Western Europe, including Great
Britain, who, by the Treaty of Vienna, guaranteed the
autonomy of Poland, never lifted a hand on behalf
of Polish independence, and acquiesced in its complete
absorption by Russia.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Turkey and later Prussia, Austria, Russia, and Great Britain.<br />
Egypt.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The ambition for extension of power on the part
of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Unsatisfied with the Island of Crete given to him
for his services to the Ottoman Empire, Mehemet Ali
sent his son Ibrahim with a force and laid siege to
Acre. He was declared a rebel, and the Turkish army
entered Syria.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Syria and Asia Minor were conquered by Ibrahim.
Russia offered aid, but on the intervention of France
the Sultan was persuaded to make peace, making over
to Mehemet Ali Syria and the province of Adena.
At the same time, in July 1833, a treaty of defensive
alliance was signed at <i>Unkiar Skelessi</i> between Russia
and Turkey, by which Russia obtained very nearly
complete ascendancy at Constantinople. Great
Britain desired to maintain the Sultan’s power: France
befriended Mehemet Ali: both were agreed in checking
Russian influence in the Levant. War broke out
again. Ibrahim gained a victory at Nissibim in June
1839, and the Turkish fleet surrendered to Mehemet
Ali at Alexandria. A quadruple treaty was signed by
Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, by which
it was proposed that Mehemet should have the hereditary
government of Egypt, should withdraw from
Syria and hold Palestine as a governor under the Porte.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
The exclusion of France from this agreement roused
great public indignation. By the aid of the Allies
Mehemet Ali was driven from Syria. Acre was captured
by Sir Charles Napier, and Mehemet submitted.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the final settlement, to which France also
agreed, Mehemet Ali abandoned all claim to provinces
outside Egypt, undertook to restore the
Turkish fleet, and was assured the hereditary possession
of Egypt. The Straits were closed to the
warships of all nations. This prevented Russia from
becoming a Mediterranean Power.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Turkey now became dependent on the protection of
Europe. Hopes of internal reform, however, never
fructified. The conflicting ambitions of European
Powers with regard to the continually shrinking
dominions of the Sultan became henceforth an increasing
source of friction.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain and Indian Troops.<br />
Afghanistan.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The close proximity of Afghanistan to India necessitated
the British Government watching jealously
the affairs of that country, and preparing for the
possibility of its being brought under the domination
of any other Power. Russian intrigues had been
throughout a source of suspicion and uneasiness.
The British policy was declared to be the maintenance
of the integrity and independence of
Afghanistan.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The British Government decided to reinstate Shah
Shuja, who was a refugee in British territory, Dost
Mahommed being in power at Kabul.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>A British Indian force advanced in March 1838,
and entered Kandahar. Shah Shuja was crowned.
Dost Mahommed withdrew, and Kabul was entered.
The war was brought to an end, but in November
1841 a revolt broke out in Kabul and there were
serious massacres. The British garrison in withdrawing
was overwhelmed between Kabul and Jalalabad.
Reinforcements, in 1842, forced the Kyber
Pass, relieved Jalalabad and occupied Kabul. The
army finally evacuated Afghanistan in December 1842.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>A ruler imposed on a free people by foreign arms
is always unpopular. The Afghans considered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Shah Shuja’s rule under the protection of British
troops might be fatal to their national independence.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This war has been described as a rash, ill-planned,
and hazardous enterprise, and was the immediate
cause of further trouble. (See p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="THE_OPIUM_WAR_IN_CHINA">THE OPIUM WAR IN CHINA<br />

<span class="subhead">1840–1842</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
China.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The Chinese still held the doctrine that no political
relations or dealings should be held with any foreign
country. The British Government under Palmerston
decided to place trade relations with China on a more
satisfactory basis, confusion and annoyance having
arisen owing to the expiry of the East India Company’s
charter. They also resolved to protect the opium
traffic in spite of the protests of the Chinese Government.
This latter reason overshadowed the others,
and the war, which was known as the Opium War,
was the subject of heated controversy in England.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Chinese Government refused to recognize the
British Commission or to come to terms on the opium
question. Reports in 1839 from Captain Elliot, the
British Trade Commissioner, led to the decision of
the British Government to send an expedition, and
war was declared in 1840.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The fleet captured Chusan, and in the following
year Amoy. Ningpo fell, and in 1842 Chapu, Woosung,
and Shanghai shared the same fate. Before Nanking
could be captured the Chinese Government proposed
terms of peace.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Nanking</i>, August 21, 1842, Hong-kong
was formally ceded to the British Crown;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Canton, Amoy, Fuchow, Ningpo, and Shanghai were
declared open to foreign trade. A war indemnity
of twelve million dollars was paid to Great Britain,
and subsequent treaties were signed for the regulation
of trade.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was the beginning of the exploitation of China
by the Western Powers. It led to further wars, and
the opium question continued to agitate public opinion
in Great Britain and cause disputes with China for
the rest of the century, until the opium trade was
finally abolished in 1913.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
The United States of America.<br />
Mexico.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836. The independence
of Texas was recognized by the United States,
but the proposal that the new state should be admitted
into the Union was declined. A strong support
for the annexation of Texas in the interests of slavery
grew up, more especially in the Southern states, and
in December 1844 resolutions were passed in both
Houses, and it was formally enrolled as a new state.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Mexican Government still claimed Texas as
a province, and its annexation by the United States
was considered an act of hostility. The Americans
had suffered long under continued acts of insult
and spoliation on the part of the Mexicans, and were
therefore prepared to fight.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Americans under Taylor invaded Mexico, won
battles at Palo Alto and Resaca and captured
Monterey. In 1847 there were more victories, the
Mexicans under Santa Anna being everywhere defeated.
The Americans entered Mexico City on
September 14th. After further fighting peace was
proclaimed at Washington in July 1848.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo</i>, February 2,
1848, Mexico ceded the whole of Texas, New Mexico,
and Upper California. The United States surrendered
their other conquests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>So far as Texas was concerned, the political opinion
in the United States was divided, and that division
was to become more serious as time went on. On
the other hand, Mexico was a troublesome neighbour,
and has continued ever since to be the cause of disturbance
and dispute.</p>

<h2 id="AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN_WAR">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN WAR<br />

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Hungary.<br />
Austria, the Southern Slavs and Russia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The fall of Metternich, who had been the champion
of despotism and reaction throughout Europe, and
the revolutionary spirit which ran through Europe
in 1848, created great unrest in the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. The Emperor Ferdinand was weak and
worthless, and the Magyars were determined not to
submit to the domination of autocratic rule in Austria.
Jellacic, the Croatian leader, hoped to create a Southern
Slav state: he co-operated with the Austrians in
opposition to Hungary, and was supported by the
Czechs of Bohemia.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Finding it impossible to come to terms with the
Emperor Ferdinand, Kossuth, the Hungarian leader,
took up an uncompromisingly hostile attitude. Jellacic
marched to Pesth. A revolutionary movement of
sympathy with Hungary broke out in Vienna. The
Emperor fled to Olmutz. Windischgrätz, the Austrian
general, marched on Vienna and took possession in
November 1848. Ferdinand abdicated, and Francis
Joseph, his nephew, became Emperor December 2nd.
The Hungarians refused to acknowledge him. There
was a rising of Roumanians in Transylvania, and the
whole Hungarian nation was called to arms.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Austrians occupied Pesth on January 5, 1849;
the Hungarians withdrew to Debreczin and were defeated
at Kapolona on February 26th. In April the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Magyar troops recovered and the Austrians were
driven out of Hungary. On April 19th Hungary
was proclaimed an independent state. Russia intervened
to assist Austria, and marched an army across
Galicia. The Hungarians were now confronted with
a force three times the size of their own, and the main
army capitulated at Vilagos on August 13, 1849.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Hungary was completely crushed and subjected to
savage punishment by its conquerors. Every vestige
of its old constitutional rights was extinguished.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>In 1860 the old Constitution was restored. In
1867 the Emperor Francis Joseph was crowned King
of Hungary. A responsible ministry was appointed,
and a financial agreement (Ausgleich) made between
Austria and Hungary.</p>

<p>Nationality asserted itself in spite of all attempts
at repression. But the Hungarians, in their turn,
held the Slav and Roumanian populations within their
borders with an iron grasp and failed to gain their
affection.</p>

<span class="subhead">1831, 1848–1849, 1859 and 1866–1867</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
The States of Italy.<br />
Austria.<br />
France.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Italy, after the fall of Napoleon, was divided into
separate ill-governed small states, with Venice and
Lombardy in the hands of Austria. The idea of
uniting Italy under one Government grew as the century
advanced, and received fresh impetus from the
revolutionary movements in Europe in 1830 and 1848.
The society, “Young Italy,” under the guidance of
Mazzini, kept the spirit of revolution alive, although
several insurrections instigated by them failed. The
expulsion of Austria became the central idea of the
movement.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The quarrels between the smaller states: the hatred
of the presence of Austria, who, under Metternich’s
guidance, desired throughout to suppress the movement:
the decline of Austrian power on the rise of
Prussia: the intervention of France to prevent Austrian
aggrandizement and to protect the Pope.</p>

<h3>Course of the Wars:</h3>

<p>The revolt in the Papal States in 1831 was suppressed
by Austrian intervention. France also intervened,
and the Austrian troops withdrew. In 1848 Sardinian
troops advanced against Austria, but after much
fighting round Verona were defeated at Santa Lucia.</p>

<p>Civil war broke out between Naples and Sicily.
Sardinia and Piedmont, under Victor Emmanuel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
his Minister, Cavour, now took the lead. France
became their ally in 1859. In spite of attempts at
mediation by Great Britain, Austria presented an
ultimatum, April 23, 1859. Napoleon III and the
Allies won victories at Magenta and Solferino. By
the <i>Peace of Villa Franca</i> in July, followed by the
<i>Treaty of Zurich</i>, November 10, 1859, Austria ceded
Lombardy but not Venice. Tuscany, Parma Modena,
and Romagna were united to Piedmont by their own
vote. Savoy and Nice were ceded to France.</p>

<p>In 1860 Garibaldi conquered Sicily and Naples.
Piedmontese troops entered the Papal States. By
1861 all Italy, with the exception of Rome and Venice,
was under Victor Emmanuel. In the North war broke
out again. The Italians were defeated by Austria at
Custozza, but after Königgrätz (see p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>) the Austrians
ceded Venice to France, and Napoleon III handed it
over to Italy. This arrangement was confirmed by the
<i>Treaty of Vienna</i>, October 3, 1866, between Austria
and Italy. In 1867 France defended the Papal States
against Garibaldi’s invasion, and he was defeated at
Mentana. Finally, in 1870, Napoleon III withdrew
his troops from Papal territory, and on September 20th
Victor Emmanuel entered Rome.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>All Italy became united under one monarch with
its capital at Rome. Victor Emmanuel was succeeded
in 1878 by Humbert, the father of King Victor Emmanuel
III.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The rivalry between Austria and Italy did not die
down, and there were still certain territories—<i>Italia
irredenta</i> (such as Trentino)—which remained in
Austrian hands.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain, France, Turkey and Sardinia.<br />
Russia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>From 1830 onwards there was a growing estrangement
between Great Britain and Russia. The Czar
Nicholas believed that the dominion of the Turk in
Europe was nearing its end, and cherished the ambition
that Russia should acquire provinces of the
Ottoman dominions. On the other hand, there was
keen opposition in Great Britain to Russia’s expansion,
and to the idea of Constantinople falling into her
hands. Louis Napoleon had only two years previously
become Emperor of the French. His dynastic
ambitions made him eager for military glory. Sardinia
joined the Allies for tactical reasons.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The French claimed the custody of the Holy Places
in Palestine: the Russians made a counter-claim to
the custody of the Holy Places and to a Protectorate
over the Greek Christians in the Ottoman Empire.
The Turkish Government, on the advice of the British
Ambassador, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, refused to
accept the Russian claims. Russian troops crossed
the Pruth in June 1853, and a Turkish squadron was
destroyed at Sinope in November. On the refusal
of Russia to make her ships re-enter port in the Black
Sea and evacuate the Danubian principalities, war
was declared by France and England on March 27, 1854.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Crimea was invaded, and fighting continued
there for two years. The Austrian attempt at mediation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
in May 1855, failed. The Russians were defeated
at Alma and Inkerman, and Sevastopol, after a long
siege, fell on September 9, 1855. The Russians captured
Kars in November.</p>

<h3>Political Results:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Paris</i>, March 30, 1856, the Black
Sea was neutralized. An engagement was made by
all the Powers to respect the independence and integrity
of the Ottoman Empire: the Sultan promised
to give equality of treatment to his Christian subjects.
The Danubian provinces were granted independence
under the sovereignty of the Sultan.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This treaty was absolutely barren. The Sultan’s
promise was never acted on: the neutrality of the
Black Sea was maintained only till 1870: and when
the integrity of the Ottoman Empire was assailed in
later years none of the signatory Powers intervened
in its defence. But at the Congress of Berlin in 1878
the Powers partitioned parts of the Ottoman Empire.
So far from settling any disputes this war caused
dissensions which led to other wars.</p>

<h2 id="THE_INDIAN_MUTINY">THE INDIAN MUTINY<br />

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
Native Indians.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The East India Company had engaged in constant
wars and employed an army in which native troops
outnumbered the British by eight to one. The Sepoys
especially became aware of their strength and importance.
In many ways religious sensibilities were
offended, dissatisfaction with the Company’s rule
spread and unrest was abroad.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The spirit of revolt grew, and a trivial incident was
sufficient to make the spark burst into a flame. Cartridges
used for the new Enfield rifle smeared with the
fat of sacred cows and the lard of polluted pigs were
to be bitten by Hindu and Mohammedan alike.
The ferment caused by the rumour spread and the
mutiny broke out.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Native troops mutinied at Mirat, and proceeded to
Delhi, Cawnpore, and Lucknow. Many British men
and women were murdered. A British force in June
and July 1857 marched on Delhi. Engagements
were fought, in which there were heavy losses. Disease
and cholera also carried off many victims. After a
great struggle Lahore was captured in September,
and Agra was relieved, also Cawnpore, where, under
Nana Sahib, the most hideous massacres and cruelty
had taken place. At Lucknow a heroic resistance
was made against an overwhelming force of rebels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
It was relieved on November 22, 1857. In March
1858, the whole province of Oudh was recovered by
Outram and Colin Campbell. Not till the beginning
of 1859 did organized resistance come to an end in all
parts of India.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the Queen’s proclamation of November 1858 the
government of India was taken over by the British
Government. The Queen declared that all her Indian
subjects should be protected in the exercise of their
religious observances. Excessive measures of repression
which had been resorted to were stopped.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Queen Victoria was styled Empress of India at the
instance of Disraeli in 1876. Various reforms have
been instituted in Indian administration tentatively
allowing Indians some share in the government of the
country. But the problem of British rule in India
is not one which is capable of final solution.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain, France.<br />
China.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The increasing commercial ambitions of Western
Powers in the East led Great Britain and France to
insist on the establishment of fair and equitable terms
of trade. The Chinese Government was in the hands
of the Tatars known as the Taipings, who, by
their successful rebellion, had overthrown the Manchu
dynasty.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The refusal of the Chinese Government to redress
long-standing grievances or to allow the diplomatic
representatives of the Western Powers to reside in
Peking; the seizure of the crew of the British ship
<i>Arrow</i> off Canton, and the refusal of the Chinese
Governor to apologize or surrender the men, and the
murder of a French missionary in Kwangsi brought
things to a head.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Canton was taken by the British in December 1857.
The Taku Forts fell in May 1858 and Tientsin was
occupied. Negotiations were attempted but failed.
An allied force of British and French landed in 1860,
marched on Peking, and the Chinese yielded.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the treaty of October 24, 1860, the Chinese paid
an indemnity of eight million taels. The right of
Europeans to travel in the interior was granted, and
freedom guaranteed to the preaching of Christianity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
By the customs tariff agreed upon the import of opium
was legalized. In the course of 1861 British, French,
and Russian legations were permanently established
at Peking, and in the following years the same right
was conceded to other European nations. By treaties
with Russia in the same year China ceded all its territory
north of the Amur to Russia, and in this territory
Vladivostock was founded.</p>

<p>Good relations having been established, the Chinese
Government, with the assistance of Gordon, carried
out a successful campaign against the Taipings, and
the Manchu dynasty was restored.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was the opening of the door into China, and
from henceforth the Western Powers began to compete
for commercial and territorial prizes in the Chinese
Empire.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
The Northern states of North America.<br />
The Southern states of North America.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The cultivation of cotton progressed under very
different conditions in the North and South. In the
North the white man had to work vigorously to overcome
the disadvantages of the soil. In the South the
negro labourer could be used with profit to his owner,
and was held as a slave. By 1860 the thirteen original
states were enlarged to thirty-three. The territories
of the North-east found their prosperity in free labour,
the South throve on the cotton crop and continued
to exploit negro labour. The Southern states gradually
combined together, and between 1830 and 1850
gained a predominant voice in the control of Federal
affairs. The North also became consolidated, and a
strong movement against slavery grew up, chiefly
owing to the efforts of W. Lloyd Garrison. A new
Republican party gained strength in its opposition
to the dominating differences of the South, and sectional
political differences were intensified. The
prospect of the abolition of slavery was not the only
issue. The South resented the idea that coercive
measures might be used to keep the lower South in
the Union. They believed this to be an attack on
the doctrine of the sovereignty of states. A widespread
feeling in favour of secession grew up.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Republican party triumphed at the election,
and Abraham Lincoln became President in November,
1860. South Carolina seceded, ten other states followed,
and the Confederate States were established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
under the Presidency of Jefferson Davis. The attack
on Fort Sumter by the Confederates on April 4, 1861,
made war inevitable.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The North was defeated at Bull Run in July 1861,
but captured forts Henry and Donelson in 1862, and
gained a victory at Shiloh. At Richmond, and later
at Fredericksburg, the North was defeated. Lincoln
issued his proclamation of Emancipation on January 1,
1863. The South, under Lee, were defeated in the
greatest battle of the war at Gettysburg, on July 4th.
In 1864 there were further victories for the North
under Grant at Spottsylvania and Coldharbour; and
Atlanta and Savanah were captured. In 1865 Petersburg
and Richmond were evacuated by the Confederates
and Lee surrendered. On May 26th the war came to
an end, after a desperate struggle of nearly four years.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The Union was restored and slavery abolished.
Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, and his
wise counsel was lost therefore for the difficult work
of reconstruction which followed the war.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Great Britain declared neutrality at the outset,
and thereby implicitly, though not explicitly, recognized
the Southern Confederacy as a belligerent Power.
There was much sympathy with the South among the
governing class, but the people were on the side of
the North. The Trent affair brought Great Britain
and America very near to war. (See <a href="#twash"><i>Treaty of Washington</i></a>,
p. 94.)</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
France.<br />
Mexican Republicans.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>From 1789, the date of the first conspiracy against
Spain, down to 1857, when a Constitution was promulgated,
Mexico was in a state of permanent warfare.
In 1861 France, Spain, and Great Britain adopted
joint measures against the republic in order to get
better protection for their subjects and their property.
In 1862 Great Britain and Spain withdrew. But
Napoleon III conceived the project of establishing a
monarchy in Mexico under his patronage, and so
increasing French ascendancy beyond the Atlantic.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The financial misdemeanours of the Mexican Government
were made the pretext for the advance of French
troops into Mexico in 1862.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The French force was checked in May 1862, and
further reinforcements were sent out. They advanced
again in February 1863, and entered Mexico City in
June. A Provisional Government was established,
and the crown was offered to Maximilian of Austria,
who accepted it and reached Mexico City in June
1864. Juarez, the republican leader, was driven into
the extreme north of the country. But his resistance
was by no means overcome. Napoleon III bound
himself to keep a force in Mexico for the protection
of Maximilian. In 1865, on the restoration of peace
after the Civil War in the United States, the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of Washington refused to acknowledge any
authority in Mexico but that of Juarez. The French
were obliged to withdraw in 1867, and Maximilian
was left to his fate. The Juarists got the upper hand,
and Maximilian was executed.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Juarez, as President of Mexico, was succeeded by
Diaz in 1877; and order was maintained for a generation.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This foolish enterprise damaged the reputation of
Napoleon III. He was regarded as a political adventurer,
and became increasingly unpopular in his own
country.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentine Republic.<br />
Paraguay.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Brazil was part of the Portuguese possessions until
1822, when it declared its independence. The Emperors
Pedro I and II had frequent trouble not only
with the republican movement in Brazil itself, but
with the neighbouring states, with whom they were
constantly at war. In 1855 Pedro II sent a squadron
up the Parana to adjust several questions outstanding
with the republic of Paraguay. Although certain
rights were granted to Brazil the Government of
Paraguay threw every obstacle in the way to prevent
a settlement.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1864 Lopez, the ambitious dictator of Paraguay,
without declaring war, captured a Brazilian vessel,
and invaded Brazil and the Argentine. Uruguay
joined them in a triple alliance of defence against
Paraguay.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Owing to the strong natural position of Paraguay,
and the obstinacy of Lopez, the war was drawn out
with constant fighting and great sacrifice of life in
addition to vast expenditure, until 1870, when it was
terminated by the capture and death of Lopez.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>External troubles ceased, but the republican movement
gained in strength until 1889, when Pedro was
deposed and a republic declared in Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The slaughter in this war was so terrific that the
population of Paraguay was reduced from 1,337,439
to 221,079.</p>

<p>This is only one example of the very frequent disturbances,
both internal and external, in the South
American continent during the course of the century.</p>

<h2 id="THE_DANISH_WAR">THE DANISH WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1864</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Denmark.<br />
Prussia and Austria.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The strong revival of nationalism in Germany after
the Napoleonic Wars spread to the German inhabitants
of the Duchies of Schleswig Holstein, who desired in
1848 to be incorporated as a single constitutional
state in the German Federation. The Danish crown
could be inherited by female heirs, but in the Duchies
the Salic law had never been repealed. This made
complications with regard to the succession. Frederick
VII of Denmark endeavoured to preserve the
Duchy as an integral part of Denmark. An insurrection
broke out, and Prussia intervened by marching
troops into Holstein. Under pressure from other
Powers the King of Prussia signed a convention at
Malmoe practically yielding all the Danish demands,
and in 1850, by the <i>Treaty of Berlin</i>, peace was restored
between Prussia and Denmark, but without any settlement
of the vexed question. In 1852 Great Britain
intervened with a proposal without success. In 1854
the King of Denmark promulgated special Constitutions
for the Duchies as well as a common Constitution
for the whole Monarchy. The German Confederation
rejected this as the Diets of the Duchies
had not been consulted. The question became of
European interest: its complexity prevented any
settlement being reached. Bismarck alone was quite
determined on eventual annexation, and Denmark
was equally determined not to yield.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>After further diplomatic disputes Austrian and
Prussian troops entered Schleswig in February 1864.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The allied troops broke through the frontier fortifications
and occupied the greater part of the Danish
mainland. The Danes were overthrown in the island
of Alsen, and the German flag carried to the northern
extremity of Denmark. A conference was opened
in London, April 1864, but the negotiations broke
down and the war continued.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Eventually, by the <i>Treaty of Vienna</i>, October 30,
1864, the King of Denmark ceded the rights in the
whole of Schleswig Holstein to the Sovereigns of
Austria and Prussia jointly.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was more a diplomatic war than a military war.
The conflict was between retention and annexation,
and little regard was paid on any side to the desires
of the inhabitants of the disputed territory. Although
by the <i>Treaty of London</i> of 1852 the Powers, including
Great Britain, had acknowledged as permanent the
principle of the integrity of the Danish Monarchy no
steps were taken by them to maintain that principle.
The settlement did nothing to prevent the outbreak
of war between Prussia and Austria two years later,
when Schleswig Holstein was again one of the bones
of contention.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Prussia and some of the smaller North German States and Italy.<br />
Austria and the other German States.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>From 1848 onwards in all the projects for a united
Germany there was keen rivalry between Prussia and
Austria. Each resisted the domination of the other in
any new Empire, and the South German states were
inclined to side with Austria against Prussian supremacy.
This state of affairs prevented any final scheme
from being agreed to. At the same time there were
serious differences between Austria and Italy, who
was Prussia’s ally. Bismarck made up his mind that
Austria must be expelled by force of arms from the
German Federation. He was an ardent supporter of
the House of Hohenzollern.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Austria supported Schleswig Holstein in their struggle
for independence against Prussia after the conclusion
of the Danish War. An attempted congress of neutrals
failed. Austria called on the Diet of Frankfort to
take the affairs of Schleswig Holstein into its own
hands, and demanded and obtained the mobilization
of the whole Federal armies. Prussia declared that
this action made an end of the Federal Union, and
submitted a new plan for the organization of Germany,
which was refused. Diplomatic relations were broken
off June 12, 1866.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Hanover and Hesse Cassel were conquered by Prussia,
the Austrians were defeated at Königgrätz, July 3,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
1866, and the Prussians pushed forward in sight of
Vienna. The Austrians defeated the Italians on land
at Custozza, and by sea at Lissa.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Napoleon III offered mediation, which was accepted.
The <i>Treaty of Prague</i>, August 23, 1866. Prussia
annexed Hanover, Nassau, Hesse Cassel, and Frankfort:
Germany north of the Main together with
Saxony was included in a Federation under Prussia:
the Southern states were left independent. Prussian
sovereignty over Schleswig Holstein was recognized.
Austria withdrew completely from German affairs.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Napoleon III had attempted, by dividing Germany
in two, to put an obstacle in the way of German
unity. His clumsy diplomacy was greatly disapproved
of in France. By preventing a final
settlement he made the recurrence of war inevitable.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
Abyssinia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>From 1855 Abyssinia came under the powerful rule
of the Emperor Theodore. He subdued the neighbouring
kingdoms of Tigré and Shoa, and took Menelek,
son of the ruler of Tigré, to be trained in his service.
He ravaged the surrounding country, and oppressed
his own people. In 1864 there was an interchange
of letters between Theodore and the British Government,
out of which difficulties arose.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The British Consul and his staff, and subsequently
a British emissary, were imprisoned in Magdala and
put in chains. Their release was demanded, but the
Emperor paid no attention, and the British Government
decided they must have recourse to arms.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>A British force under Sir Robert Napier landed in
January 1868, a march of three hundred miles was
undertaken through the mountainous districts, and,
after a fierce engagement, Magdala was stormed and
taken on April 13, 1868. The Emperor committed
suicide, and his son was taken to England, where
he died. The British troops left the country in
May 1868.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The ruler of Tigré succeeded Theodore under the
title of King John, and on his death, in 1889, Menelek
became Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>After this the Italians came on to the scene with
ambitions in this part of Africa (see p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>), but Abyssinia
remained an independent kingdom. In the
various expeditions against the Mullah in Somaliland
(1902–4) the Abyssinians co-operated with Great
Britain.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
France.<br />
Prussia and ten other German States.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>For some years previously there had been increasing
friction between France and Prussia, owing chiefly to
Louis Napoleon’s apprehensions as to the possibility
of closer union between Prussia and the South German
states, his repeated endeavours to extend the Eastern
frontier of France, and Bismarck’s counter-moves to
frustrate his designs. The desire also for a united
Germany was growing stronger, and Bismarck believed
it could not be completed without a conflict
with France.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The candidature of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern
Sigmaringen for the throne of Spain in 1870 was resented
by France as calculated to bring Spain under
the influence of Prussia. King William of Prussia,
on representations from France, persuaded Prince
Leopold to withdraw, but refused firmly but politely
a guarantee against the renewal of the candidature.
Bismarck published a telegram conveying the impression
that the French Ambassador, Benedetti, had
been insulted by the King at Ems on the occasion
of the refusal. This infuriated public opinion in
France, the Empress Eugénie actively used her influence,
and Napoleon agreed to a declaration of war
on July 14, 1870.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>In the war, which lasted from July 1870 to
February 1871, the ill-organized and badly led French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
troops could make no stand against the well-prepared
armies of Germany. The French were defeated at
Wörth, August 6th; Metz, August 7th; Marsla Tour,
August 17th; Gravelotte, August 18th. Paris was
besieged: Louis Napoleon capitulated at Sedan, September
2nd; Strasburg fell, September 28th; Bazaine
capitulated at Metz, October 27th; and the Germans
entered Paris on January 28, 1871.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Frankfort</i>, May 10, 1871, Alsace
and half Lorraine (with Metz) were ceded to Germany,
and an indemnity of 200 millions was exacted from
France. The King of Prussia was proclaimed at
Versailles German Emperor. France was declared
a republic, and Napoleon eventually retired into
exile in England.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The dictation of terms and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine
entirely prevented friendly relations from
being established between the two countries in the
succeeding years. France, by getting rid of the corrupt
and incompetent government of Napoleon III, began
to recuperate from this time onward. Germany,
having reached the ideal of unity, proceeded gradually
to join in the competition for commercial expansion
and Imperial aggrandizement.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ASHANTI_WAR">THE ASHANTI WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1873–1874</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
The Ashantis.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The Ashantis, a very fierce and warlike tribe on the
Gold Coast of Africa had repeatedly caused trouble
owing to their treatment of the Fantis, a tribe on the
coast under British protection. In 1824 they defeated
a British force and carried off to Kumasi the skull
of the Governor, Sir Charles M’Carthy, which was
used as a royal drinking cup. They were afterwards
defeated in 1826. In 1863 an expedition against them
had to be abandoned owing to the ravages done by
sickness among the troops. In 1867 a warlike king,
Kofi Karikari succeeded as ruler and proceeded to
make hostile preparations against the Fantis.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1872 some Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast
were transferred to Great Britain. The King of
Ashanti claimed a tribute formerly allowed to him
by the Dutch and refused to evacuate the territory
ceded to Britain. He also held four Europeans in
captivity. The British Government determined to
take up the matter seriously, and when in January
1873 an Ashanti force invaded the British Protectorate
an expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley was immediately
despatched.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Owing to difficulties of climate it was necessary
that the whole campaign should be rapidly carried
out. The Ashantis were defeated at all points. Kumasi
was reached and King Kofi surrendered. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
European troops suffered severely from fever but the
objects were successfully accomplished. Wolseley sailed
from England on September 12, 1873, and returned
to Portsmouth on March 21, 1874.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The King renounced his claim to supremacy over
any part of the former Dutch protectorate, paid an
indemnity in gold, and agreed to prohibit human
sacrifices. Further trouble arose, however, after the
death of the King, his successors disregarding the
treaty. In 1895 an expedition was sent out under
Colonel Sir F. Scott. Kumasi was occupied and
King Prempeh deported. Still the Ashanti tribes
refused to submit, and continued in rebellion. The
Governor of the Gold Coast and a small force were
surrounded in Kumasi. He managed to escape and
Kumasi was finally relieved by an expedition under
Colonel Wilcocks who gradually suppressed the rebellion.
By an Order in Council of September 26, 1901,
Ashanti was formally annexed to the British dominions
and given a separate administration under the control
of the Governor of the Gold Coast.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Imperial responsibilities entail the protection of
friendly tribes against hostile attack in the outlying
parts of the Empire. Punitive expeditions become
necessary and annexation is found to be the best
method of securing law and order.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Russia.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The persecution and oppression of Christians in
the Ottoman Empire led to a revolt in Herzegovina
in 1875. Andrassy, on behalf of Austria, presented
a Note to the Turkish Government demanding reforms,
and this was followed by the Berlin Memorandum,
signed by Germany, France, Austria, Russia, and Italy.
Great Britain alone stood out. The Bulgarian massacres
in June 1876 caused a great sensation in England,
and were followed by a declaration of war by Servia
and Montenegro against Turkey. Great Britain,
always mistrusting Russian designs, called a Conference.
The demands of the Conference were rejected
by Turkey in January 1877. The Sultan protested
against the encroachment of the Powers on his inviolable
rights.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The London Protocol of March 1877, signed by
Great Britain and Russia and agreed to by the other
Powers, called for reforms and expressed the intention
of the Powers to safeguard the Christian population.
This was also rejected by the Turks, and Russia declared
war on April 24, 1877.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Russian army crossed the Danube. Plevna
fell in December 1877. The Russians entered Adrianople,
January 1878. The advance of the Russian
army towards Gallipoli was followed by the dispatch
of the British fleet to Constantinople and brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Russia and Great Britain within a hair’s-breadth of
war. This, however, was avoided and peace negotiations
began.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p><i>Treaty of San Stefano</i>, March 3, 1878. The independence
of Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania was
recognized. Bulgaria was made an autonomous principality
with frontiers including the greater part of
European Turkey; the Dobrudja and certain districts
in Asia Minor were ceded to Russia.</p>

<p>Great Britain objected strongly to this treaty, and
proposed a Congress at Berlin. While the chances of
the Congress hung in the balance, Great Britain made
warlike preparations, but the Congress was finally
agreed to.</p>

<p><i>Treaty of Berlin</i>, July 13, 1878. Bulgaria’s frontier
was confined to the country north of the Balkans.
Bosnia and Herzegovina were handed over to Austria:
the territory given to Serbia and Montenegro was
further restricted: Thessaly and part of Epirus were
ceded to Greece.</p>

<p>By a secret convention Great Britain engaged to
protect Turkey against further aggression of Russia
in Asia. In return the Porte assigned Cyprus to be
occupied and administered by England.</p>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield was the British Plenipotentiary
at the Peace Congress and returned declaring he had
secured “peace with honour.”</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was a patched-up peace. It settled none
of the problems in the Balkans, which continued to
be the danger zone in Europe for the rest of the
century.</p>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain and Indian Troops.<br />
Afghanistan.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>In 1868 the expanding power of Russia in Asia
resulted in Bokhara becoming a Russian dependency.
In 1873 Russia conquered Khiva. Shere Ali, now
ruler of Afghanistan, became alarmed, but failing to
come to an understanding with the British Government,
he began to make overtures to Russia. In
1877 an offer of alliance was made by the Viceroy of
India, but Shere Ali refused to admit a British Agent
into Afghanistan.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1878 the Russian Government sent an envoy to
Kabul to make a treaty with the Amir. A British
army was also sent, but was turned back on the frontier,
and hostilities were proclaimed by the Viceroy.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Two British forces marched into the interior of
Afghanistan, and occupied important positions.
Shere Ali fled from his capital, and died in February
1879. By the <i>Treaty of Gandamuk</i>, May 1879,
Yakub Khan was recognized as Amir, and he agreed
that a British envoy should reside at his Court. In
September 1879, the envoy, his staff, and his escort
were massacred. A fresh expedition was sent under
Sir F. Roberts, who entered Kabul. In 1880, Abdur
Rahman, nephew of Shere Ali, returned from exile
in Russia and established himself in the northern
provinces. The British Government came to an
agreement with him, and he was recognized as Amir.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
In July 1880 Ayub Khan, another son of Shere Ali,
defeated a British force at Maiwand. Roberts reached
Kandahar from Kabul by a rapid march, and defeated
Ayub Khan on September 1, 1880. Again, in July
1881, Ayub Khan returned and took possession of
Kandahar, but was finally routed by Abdur Rahman
in September.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The frontiers of Afghanistan were delimited in
agreement with Russia. Abdur Rahman’s rulership
over Afghanistan was established. He extended and
consolidated his dominion over the whole country,
and was peacefully succeeded by his son Habibullah
in 1901.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>By the Anglo-Russia Convention of 1907, Great
Britain engaged not to alter the political status of
Afghanistan, and Russia recognized it as outside her
sphere of influence.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ZULU_WAR">THE ZULU WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1879</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
The Zulus.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The warlike and threatening attitude of the Zulus
under Cetywayo constituted a perpetual menace to
the safety of the British possessions in South Africa.
The policy of Sir Bartle Frere, Governor of the Cape
and High Commissioner, was the eventual Federation
of all South African states under British rule, and it
was essential, therefore, in his opinion, that the white
inhabitants should be secured against native raids.
There was a strong opinion that this could be effected
without force of arms.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The cruelties and excesses practised by Cetywayo
culminated in a raid into Natal, where women were
carried off and murdered. Frere issued an ultimatum
demanding the break-up of the military system of
Zululand, and further that a British Resident was to
be received and missionaries were not to be molested.
No reply was received, and British troops entered
Zululand on January 10, 1879.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Frere’s application for reinforcements was refused
by the British Government. But after a British
defeat at Isandhlwana, January 22, 1879, which was
only prevented from being a disaster by the gallant
defence of Rorke’s Drift, Sir Garnet Wolseley was
sent out with more troops. The Zulus were defeated
at Ulundi, July 5th, and Cetywayo was taken prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Zululand was divided into thirteen districts, each
with a separate chief, and was placed under a British
Resident. It was finally annexed in 1887.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This war is only an episode in the extension and
consolidation of the British Empire in South Africa.
But it is an instance of the grave responsibilities which
are involved in Imperial expansion.</p>

<p>In the course of the war the Prince Imperial, only
son of Napoleon III, was killed, and with him died
the last hopes of a restoration of the Napoleonic
dynasty in France.</p>

<span class="subhead">1879–1882</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Chile.<br />
Peru. Bolivia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>After the blockade and bombardment of their ports
by a Spanish squadron in 1865, on account of their
sympathy with Peru in a quarrel with Spain, the
Chileans were impressed with the necessity of possessing
an adequate fleet to defend their long coast line.
Ships were obtained and officers trained, so that Chile
became well equipped for any future encounter.</p>

<p>The authorities of Bolivia seized the effects of the
Chilean Nitrate Company at Antofogasta.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Five hundred soldiers were despatched to protect
Chilean interests. The force landed and marched
inland. Bolivia declared war on March 1st, Peru on
April 5, 1879.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Chileans occupied every port on the Bolivian
coast, and engaged the Peruvian fleet. The <i>Huascar</i>,
a Peruvian ironclad, after other ships had been
destroyed, did great damage under four successive
commanders, but after severe fighting was forced to
surrender off Angamos, and the Peruvian navy ceased
to exist. After several engagements on land the Chileans
succeeded in taking possession of the Bolivian seaboard
and the Peruvian province of Tarapaca.</p>

<p>Fighting continued in 1880 when, in spite of daring
resistance, the Peruvians were defeated at all points.
Lima was occupied on January 17, 1881, and Callao<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
surrendered on January 18th. The last engagement
took place in September 1882, and a small army of
occupation was left in Peru.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The Treaty of Peace was not ratified till April 1884.
Peru ceded to Chile the province of Tarapaca. The
provinces of Tacna and Arica were placed under
Chilean authority for ten years, after which they were
to decide their own future government. Chile, however,
eventually evaded compliance with this agreement
and retained forcible possession of the provinces.
Chile retained possession of the Bolivian seaboard,
thus cutting off Bolivia from access to the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The aggressive attitude of Chile was a cause of
complaint with the neighbouring states, and nearly
led on more than one occasion to further conflict.
By a Treaty signed in 1905, however, Bolivia at last
ceded all claims to a seaport and strip of coast. Chile,
except for a civil war in 1891, is distinguished among
the South American States by its freedom from revolution
and serious political unrest.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
France.<br />
The Arabs of Tunis.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Tunis under the government of the Beys formed
part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1862 Italy began
to take an interest in Tunis. A triple British, French,
and Italian control over Tunisian finances was established
in 1869. In 1878, at the Congress of Berlin,
Great Britain came to a secret understanding to allow
France a free hand in Tunis in return for French
acquiescence in the British lease of Cyprus.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1880 the Italians bought the British railway
from Tunis to Golitta. France, under the pretext
of chastising independent tribes in the north-east,
determined to take action.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>A French force marched on the capital. The conquest
of the country was not effected without serious
resistance, specially at Sjax, but finally the whole
country was brought completely under French jurisdiction,
and the Bey was compelled to accept a French
protectorate.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Bardo</i>, May 12, 1881, and a further
<i>Treaty of La Marsa</i>, June 8, 1883, the French protectorate
was established. Italy did not recognize
the full consequences of the French protectorate till
1896. Protests by Turkey were ignored by France,
and in 1892 the Ottoman Government was prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to delimit the Tunis-Tripoli frontier. But there were
various frontier incidents, and Turkey maintained
the claim that the Tunisians were Ottoman subjects.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The occupation of Tunis led to an estrangement
between France and Italy.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EGYPTIAN_WAR">THE EGYPTIAN WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1882</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
Egypt.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Since 1840, while Egypt had been virtually independent,
Great Britain had been regarded as the special
champion of Turkish suzerainty; France as the protector
of the Viceroys of Egypt. The construction
of the Suez Canal, chiefly engineered by France and
Great Britain, made Egypt of new importance, as the
direct route to India now lay through the Red Sea.
An Anglo-French financial control was established to
secure payment of interest on the enormous sums lent
to the Khedive Ismail. British influence became
paramount, and the British Government gradually
assumed the responsibility for good government in
Egypt.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>An anti-Turkish revolt under Arabi Pasha broke out,
and there was a massacre of Christians in Alexandria
in June 1882. The Khedive was powerless. The
Powers met in conference at Constantinople, but
before any decision was arrived at the British Government
resolved to act.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The bombardment of Alexandria took place on
July 11, 1882, and the Egyptian troops set fire to the
town. The Sultan was willing to enter into a military
convention with Great Britain, but before it was
signed the Egyptians were defeated at Tel-el Kebir
by the British under Sir Garnet Wolseley, on September
13, 1882, and Arabi surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>Arabi and other Pashas were banished to Ceylon.</p>

<p>The military occupation of Egypt by Great Britain,
in spite of declarations to the effect that the troops
would shortly be withdrawn, and in spite of protests
from France, became permanent.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Till the Anglo-French agreement of 1904 France
adopted a more or less hostile attitude with regard
to Egypt. Many administrative and financial reforms
were introduced by Sir Evelyn Baring, afterwards
Lord Cromer. The government was practically taken
out of the hands of the Egyptians, and from time to
time there was trouble with a nationalist movement.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
France.<br />
China.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>France, after 1870, turned its attention more and
more to colonial expansion in Africa, and also in Asia,
where for some time efforts had been made by the
French to indemnify themselves in Indo-China for
the loss of Hindustan. In 1875 a vague treaty with
the Emperor of Annam gave France the protectorate.
The importance was realized of finding a path of penetration
towards China.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In 1883–1884 an attempt was made to force the
Emperor of Annam to acknowledge the protectorate
and to secure the delta of Tonkin. The Chinese
Government, unwilling to have France as a neighbour,
took the offensive.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The French fleet destroyed the arsenal of Foochow,
took possession of Formosa, Kelung, and the Pescadores
Islands, and blockaded Southern China. A French
brigade was put to flight near Langsen. Incorrect
information as to the extent of the reverse caused
the overthrow of Jules Ferry’s ministry. But the
victories and blockade of the French fleet induced
China to accept peace.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Tientsin</i>, June 9, 1885, China
recognized the French protectorate in Tonkin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Annam, and promised to open the southern provinces
to French traders.</p>

<p>By treaties with Siam in 1893, and Great Britain
in 1892–1896, Cambodia came also under French protection,
and the Empire in Indo-China was consolidated.</p>

<p>France definitely joined in the competition for
Imperial expansion.</p>

<span class="subhead">1823–1826, 1851, 1885</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
Burma.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The expansion of the British Empire in India involved
the subjection of neighbouring states. In
addition to this there was fear of the rivalry of France
in Burma.</p>

<h3>Occasions:</h3>

<p>(1) The conquest of Assam, which was under British
protection, by the King of Ava in 1823, and the attack
by him on a British fort at Shapur, led to the declaration
of war against Burma.</p>

<p>(2) The insults offered to the British flag at Rangoon
by the King of Ava, led to the fresh outbreak of war
in 1851.</p>

<p>(3) King Thibaw’s despotic rule and his design to
enter into an agreement with France, led to the last
Ultimatum in 1885.</p>

<h3>Course of the Wars:</h3>

<p>(I) A British force was defeated at Ramu, and the
first two attempts to reach Ava failed. Martaban
and Tennasserin were taken by the British, and the
Burmese were expelled from Rangoon in December
1824. Prome was reached in April 1825. Myede
was entered in December. In 1826 Sir Archibald
Campbell pushed on to Yandabu, forty-five miles from
Ava. By the treaty of peace February 24, 1826, the
British gained the provinces of Assam, Arakan, and
the coast of Tenasserim.</p>

<p>(II) In April, 1852, as the King of Ava refused to
come to terms, Rangoon, Martaban, and Bassein were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
taken by Dalhousie. Prome was taken in October,
and Pegu in November 1852. No treaty was signed
but the King was prepared to accept an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>(III) In 1885 the British Ultimatum took King
Thibaw by surprise, and within a fortnight he surrendered
unconditionally when the British force approached
his capital. Guerilla warfare continued for
nearly two years.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the proclamation of January 1, 1886, the whole
of Burma was annexed, and Thibaw was deported to
India.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The conquest of Burma was affected, not so much
because of the misrule of the Kings of Ava as from
a motive of Imperial expansion and the desire to
forestall the designs of France.</p>

<span class="subhead">1885</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Bulgaria.<br />
Serbia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The Treaty of Berlin of 1878 left abundant material
for future conflict in European Turkey. Bulgaria
was confined to the north of the Balkan mountains,
and Eastern Roumelia was still under the Sultan.
Prince Alexander of Battenberg, the ruler of Bulgaria,
in September 1885, marched south and occupied
Philippopolis. The Sultan protested, the Czar was
indignant, but Great Britain approved the Union of
Roumelia with Bulgaria, and the danger of war passed
away. The success of Bulgaria whetted the appetite
of Milan, who had become King of Serbia in 1882.
With a view to strengthening the prestige of his dynasty
he adopted a spirited foreign policy and awaited an
opportunity.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Frontier troubles and tariff disputes between the
two countries had embittered relations, and the King
of Serbia declared war, thinking he would have a
triumphal march to Sofia, the Russian officers having
withdrawn from the Bulgarian army.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Bulgarians gained a decisive victory at Slivnitsa
on November 16, 1885, and occupied Pirot, and
the road to Belgrade lay open before them. But
Austria intervened on behalf of Serbia, and after
fourteen days’ fighting an armistice was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Buckarest</i>, March 3, 1886, the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i> was restored; Bulgaria gained nothing, but
established her right to Eastern Roumelia. Owing
to Russian intrigue Alexander was forced to abdicate
and was succeeded by Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg as
Prince of Bulgaria.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Bulgaria became gradually the most advanced and
formidable state in the Balkans. In 1908, at the
time of the revolutionary crisis in Turkey and the
annexation of Bosnia and Herzogovina by Austria,
Ferdinand declared himself Czar of a completely
independent Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Milan abdicated in 1889, and his son Alexander
became King of Serbia. He and his wife were murdered
in 1903 and Peter Karageorgevich accepted the
crown.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Japan.<br />
China and Korea.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Japan adopting Western ideas developed into a
powerful state with surprising rapidity during the
last fifty years of the nineteenth century. The growth
of her armaments and an ambition for expansion
necessarily followed. China, on the other hand, did
not welcome the influence of the West, which rapid
transit and communication had brought into Asia.
The weakness and misgovernment of Korea was a
perpetual temptation to her neighbours. Japan invited
China to co-operate in demanding reforms in
Korea, but China refused and Japan acted alone.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In July 1894 Japan issued an Ultimatum calling
on Korea to accept a Japanese programme of reforms.
Korea temporized, and Seoul, the capital, was taken
without difficulty, the Emperor being made a prisoner.
China immediately intervened.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>By land and sea the Japanese, who had been trained
by European officers, were easily victorious. Asan
was occupied, a victory was gained off the Yalu River,
and the Japanese marched on Yingkow. Port Arthur,
on the Liao-Tung peninsula, was captured, finally
Wei-hai-Wei fell, and Li Hung Chang, the Chinese
Minister, sued for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Shimonoseki</i>, China ceded to Japan
the Liao Tung peninsula, the island of Formosa and
the Pescadores Islands, and the indemnity was fixed
at 200 million taels. But Russia, France, and Germany
intervened, and ordered Japan to surrender the Liao
Tung Peninsula on the ground that Port Arthur
threatened the independence of Peking. But the
insincerity of the intervention of the Western Powers
was revealed in 1897, when China was compelled to
lease Kiao Chow to Germany, Port Arthur to Russia,
Wei-hai-Wei to Great Britain, while France obtained
a concession near Tonkin. Only the Italian claim for
the port of Sanmen was refused by China.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The encroachments of the Western Powers evoked
intense indignation in China. The rivalry in the
exploitation of the Far East by the West had begun
in real earnest.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Italy.<br />
Abyssinia.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Having become a united nation, Italy soon developed
Imperialistic ambitions. She looked towards Tunis,
but was forestalled there by France in 1881. In 1884,
being secure from an attack by land, by an alliance
with Austria concluded in 1882, and being assured by
Great Britain that the occupation by a friendly Power
of certain positions on the Red Sea littoral would not
be regarded unfavourably, the Italian Government
decided on a forward policy in Africa.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>After a preliminary expedition in 1887, which was
unsuccessful and had to be recalled, a treaty was
made with Menelek, after the death of King John of
Abyssinia, which was interpreted in Italy as involving
Italian suzerainty over Abyssinia. Italy supported
Menelek against his rival Ras Mangascia.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Italian victories over the Dervishes at Agordat
(1893) and Cassala (1894) encouraged the ambition
of Italy for a vast African Empire. On a further
Italian advance in 1895 the Abyssinians united in
their resistance. Menelek repudiated all idea of a
protectorate, and General Baratieri suffered a disastrous
defeat at Adowah, March 1, 1896.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>The Italian suzerainty over Abyssinia was abandoned,
and by the Treaty of Peace signed in September 1900,
the frontiers of the Italian colony were reduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The attempt on the part of Italy to hunt with the
lions in colonial aggrandizement ended in humiliation.
Italy was now able to devote its attention to much-needed
internal reforms. But the Imperialist policy
only died down to be revived later.</p>

</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain—Egypt.<br />
Arabs and Dervishes.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The Soudan had fallen into the hands of rebellious
tribes under the Mahdi. In 1883 on Egyptian force
under General Hicks had been defeated at El Obeid,
and General Baker was also defeated in his attempt to
relieve the Tokar garrison. The successes of a British
force near Suakin were rendered useless by the refusal
of the British Government to advance further. Early
in 1884 it was decided to despatch General Gordon,
who had an intimate knowledge of the country, to
bring away Europeans from the Soudan. On arriving
at Khartoum he was cut off from all communication
with Egypt, Berber and the Bahr-el-Gazal province
having fallen into the hands of the Mahdi. The relief
expedition was sent out too late to save him. Khartoum
fell, and Gordon was killed on January 25, 1885. The
whole of the Soudan remained under the rule of the
Mahdi for thirteen years. The British Government
came to the conclusion that Egypt could never be
considered permanently secure so long as a hostile
Power was in occupation of Khartoum.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>After the Italian defeat at Adowah it was decided
to create a diversion in Italian interests, and orders were
given to occupy the province of Dongola. Rumours
of the crumbling power of the Khalifa, who had
succeeded the Mahdi, strengthened the idea that it
was a favourable opportunity to advance into the
Soudan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>British and Egyptian troops under Kitchener occupied
Dongola September 23, 1896. In 1897 desert
railways were constructed, and Abu Hamed and
Berber were wrested from the dervishes. In 1898
reinforcements of British troops were sent from Cairo.
Omdurman, the stronghold of Mahdism, was captured
on September 2, 1898, and two days later Khartoum
was occupied.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By an agreement between the British and Egyptian
Governments in January 1899, the Soudan was placed
under their joint control, the Governor-General to
be appointed by the Khedive on British recommendation.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The arrival of Major Marchand at Fashoda, in
September 1898, where he hoisted the French flag,
created a momentary excitement and talk of war,
but the British Government adopted a firm attitude,
and he received orders to withdraw.</p>

<p>No opposition to the Anglo-Egyptian agreement
was encountered in Europe. The economic and agricultural
development of the Soudan has since progressed
rapidly.</p>

<p>Nearly a million square miles were added to the
territory under British rule.</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Crete, which formed part of the Ottoman Dominion,
had been granted a Constitution in 1868. A revolt
in 1889 caused the Sultan to limit the powers of the
assembly and supersede the Christian governor by a
Mussulman. Disturbances broke out between Christians
and Mohammedans in the succeeding years. In
February 1897 the Christians proclaimed union with
Greece, and Colonel Vassos was sent with a force to
occupy the island in the King’s name. The Powers
intervened, and the Admirals occupied Canea. Neither
the Sultan nor the King wanted war. The King was
under the impression that the Powers would prevent it.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Enthusiasm for war which was not accompanied by
any sort of military organization or preparation grew
up in Greece. When armed bands crossed the frontier
into Macedonia, Turkey immediately declared war
(April 17, 1897).</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Greek fleet, on which great hopes had been placed,
effected nothing. The Turkish forces occupied Larissa,
advanced across Thessaly, defeated the Greeks all
along the line, and on May 17, 1897, the victory of
Domokos opened to the Turks the pass which leads
down to Lamia. The Powers intervened, and a
armistice was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the treaty of peace signed at Constantinople,
December 4, 1897, the Turks evacuated Thessaly, and
certain strategic alterations were made in the frontier.
Greece paid an indemnity of four millions, and accepted
the European control of her finances. Crete continued
to be the arena of periodic conflict. Prince
George of Greece was appointed High Commissioner
of the Powers under a new Constitution, but he resigned
in 1906. While virtually Greek the island
remained under the suzerainty of the Sultan.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was only one of the many Balkan conflicts.
The intervention of the Powers was invoked in order
to check any increase in the dominion of the Sultan.
But owing to their own conflicting ambitions and the
inherent racial complications in the Balkans, they
never at any time reached a solution of the problems
involved.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SPANISH-AMERICAN_WAR">THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1897–1898</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Spain.<br />
The United States of America.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The decline of the Spanish Colonial Empire (which
had reached its highest point under Philip II at the
end of the sixteenth century) continued throughout
the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth
century, and was hastened by the misgovernment,
corruption, and incessant outbreaks of revolution in
Spain itself. One by one by means of revolution,
the Spanish-American colonies had gained their independence.
The policy of the Holy Alliance and of
Metternich was to check the growth of Constitutional
government in Europe. King Ferdinand of Spain
was in conflict with the constitutional movement,
and civil war prevailed. In 1823 France intervened
in Spain on behalf of Ferdinand, and French troops
entered Madrid. Canning, on behalf of Great Britain,
prohibited the conquest by France or her allies of the
Spanish colonies, and formally recognized their independence
in 1824. Cuba and other islands were the
last of the Spanish possessions. During the remainder
of the nineteenth century Spain continued periodically
to be torn and weakened by internal disturbances.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In order to quell the revolts in Cuba more effectually
the milder policy of Martinez Campos was exchanged
in 1897 for the ruthless and brutal rule of
General Weyler. The United States were deeply
stirred by the torture and starvation of their neighbours.
General Weyler was recalled. But when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
American cruiser <i>Maine</i> was blown up in the port of
Havana, the United States demanded the evacuation
of Cuba by Spain. Spain refused.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>Two Spanish fleets were destroyed in May and July
1898, and American land forces in Cuba, the Philippines,
and Porto Rico won those islands with comparatively
little struggle.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the treaty of peace signed at Paris, December
1898, Spain surrendered practically all her colonies.
The Caroline Islands in the Pacific were sold to
Germany in 1899.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was the last chapter in the extinction of a vast
colonial Empire, which was dissolved owing to the
spirit of independence in its various states and the
bad government in the Mother Country.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BOER_WAR">THE BOER WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1881, 1899–1902</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain.<br />
The Transvaal and Orange Free State.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The premature annexation of the Transvaal in 1877
was resented by the majority of the Boers. In 1880
a formidable rebellion broke out, a small British force
was sent out which met with determined opposition at
Laing’s Nek and Ingogo, and on February 27, 1881,
was defeated at Majuba Hill. The Boers regained their
independence under the suzerainty of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Cecil Rhodes, with vast ideas of Imperial expansion,
became the dominating influence in South Africa.
In 1884 Bechuanaland was annexed. In 1889 Rhodes
founded the British South Africa Company. In
1896, after a successful conflict with the Matabeles,
Buluwayo was captured and Matabeleland added to
the territory of Rhodesia. In 1886 gold had been
discovered in the Transvaal, and a great cosmopolitan
city arose at Johannesburg. This resulted in
an enormous influx of Europeans and the decision
of the Boers to exclude them from any share in the
political life of the country. Behind Rhodes, who
became Prime Minister of Cape Colony in 1895, great
financial interests grew up and exerted considerable
influence. Under the presidency of Kruger the Boers
adopted a more and more hostile attitude towards
the Outlanders. In 1895 the Jameson Raid, which
was connived at by the authorities, revived Kruger’s
power, which had been waning, and made the Boers
arm in preparation for a further surprise.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>A promise of intervention was sent by the British
Government in reply to a petition from the Outlanders
in 1899. Attempts to reach a compromise with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Kruger failed. Both sides were preparing for war,
and the mining interests exerted great pressure. On
October 9, 1899, the Transvaal issued an Ultimatum.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Boers invaded Natal and Cape Colony;
Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley were invested.
British defeats at Magersfontein, Stormberg, and Colenso
(December 1899) led to Lord Roberts being sent out to
supersede General Buller. Kimberley and Ladysmith
were relieved, Bloemfontein fell. In May 1900 Mafeking
was relieved, and in June Johannesburg and Pretoria
were occupied. The attempt to insist on unconditional
surrender prolonged the war for two more years.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Vereeniging</i>, May 1902, the Transvaal
lost its independence. The Orange Free State
had been annexed in 1900. Under pressure from
the financial interests Chinese were introduced to
work the gold-mines. This was one of the chief
reasons for the fall of the Conservative Government
in 1906. Campbell-Bannerman, who became Prime
Minister, solved the problem of the future of the
Transvaal by granting them full self-government,
and the importation of Chinese was stopped.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>The origin of the war can be directly traced to
far less worthy causes than that of redressing the
grievances of the Outlanders. The war was unnecessarily
prolonged by an underestimate of the strength
of the Boers and the desire to humiliate them. But the
grant of self-government was the act that saved
the war from being barren in results and from being
the precursor of further trouble. The Union of South
Africa was established in 1909.</p>

<p>The Powers of Europe, with the exception of Italy,
adopted an unfriendly attitude towards Great Britain
during the war.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BOXER_RISING_IN_CHINA">THE BOXER RISING IN CHINA<br />

<span class="subhead">1899–1900</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Great Britain, Russia, Germany, France, and Japan.<br />
China.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>The humiliating results of the war of 1894–5 (p. 72)
killed the reform movement in China and brought the
reactionary party, headed by the Dowager-Empress,
back to power. A society called the Boxers spread
very rapidly through the provinces, preaching death
to foreigners and receiving official support.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>Attacks on Europeans began in 1899, and became
very frequent in the early months of 1900. In May
the Ministers at Peking asked for additional guards.
The Boxers surrounded the city, and Admiral Seymour’s
attempt to reach the capital was frustrated. The
destruction of the Taku Fort by the Allies was treated
as a declaration of war, and Chinese Imperial troops
joined the Boxers.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The settlements at Tientsin were rescued by a Russian
force. An allied force made its way through from
Taku, and forced an entry into Pekin. In August a
relief column of 18,000 allied troops defeated the
Chinese in several engagements and marched on Pekin.
The legations had for eight weeks withstood a siege.
The Chinese Government gave foreigners twenty-four
hours to leave the capital. The German Minister
was murdered in the street. The British Legation
formed the refuge of all those who were driven out
of their places of retreat. When the relieving force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
arrived the Chinese only made a faint-hearted defence.
The Empress fled, the legations were relieved, and
Pekin was occupied.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the peace protocol, which was signed on September
7, 1901, the punishment of the ringleaders was
demanded: the forts between Pekin and the sea were
dismantled, permanent guards for the legations were
established, and a large indemnity was fixed.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Official intercourse with the Chinese Government
was established on a more satisfactory basis. But
serious trouble in the Far East and internal disturbances
in China itself continued.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RUSSO-JAPANESE_WAR">THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1904–1905</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Russia.<br />
Japan.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>When Port Arthur, which Japan had been forced
to surrender in 1895, was seized by Russia there was
deep indignation in Japan. In 1902 a treaty of
alliance was concluded between Great Britain and
Japan. Russia undertook to evacuate Manchuria,
and although the withdrawal of troops began in 1903,
instead of continuing the evacuation Russia demanded
new concessions. In Korea Russian speculators obtained
concessions, and influential members of the
Russian Court were interested in the enterprise. Japan
protested.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>A treaty regulating the position in Manchuria and
Korea was suggested by Japan, but Russia refused
to recognize Japan’s paramount influence in Korea,
and after several months of fruitless negotiation Japan
issued an Ultimatum in February 1904.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>After successful initial encounters on the part of
Japan, Port Arthur was surrendered on January 1,
1905. After a Japanese victory at Mukden, the
Russians retreated. In October 1904 the Russian
fleet, coming round from the Baltic, opened fire on a
group of Hull fishing smacks in crossing the Dogger
Bank, mistaking them for torpedo boats. The incident
roused considerable indignation in Britain, but
the Czar expressed his regrets. The matter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
referred to a commission of admirals in Paris, and
compensation was awarded for the damage done. On
May 27, 1905 the Russian fleet was annihilated by
Admiral Togo at Tsushima. The Japanese landed a
force in Sakhalin, but, both sides being exhausted and
anxious for peace, negotiations were opened in August
1905.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Portsmouth</i>, August 1905, the
claims of Japan in Korea were recognized; Russia
agreed to evacuate Manchuria and ceded the Liao-Tung
peninsula (including Port Arthur) and the
southern half of Sakhalin to Japan. The payment
of an indemnity, which had been the chief obstacle
to the conclusion of peace, was waived by Japan.
The moderation of the Japanese demands made a
good impression in the world, but was resented in
Japan itself.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>This was a war of pure aggression, backed by high
financial speculation on the part of Russia. The easy
triumph of Japan was a surprise. But she was fighting
for definite national objects, while the Russian people
knew nothing of the cause and aims of the war. Russia
spent much money in subsequent years in restoring
her lost armaments. From this time on the reform
movements and revolutionary spirit in Russia grew
rapidly.</p>

<h2 id="TURKO-ITALIAN_WAR">TURKO-ITALIAN WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1911–1912</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Italy.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>After the agreements with regard to North Africa
between Great Britain and France, Italy made up her
mind that the time was favourable for a decisive move
with a view to expansion, and proceeded to make
careful preparations for military action early in 1911.
The position in Tripoli was made the subject of heated
discussion in the Press, and the Turks were charged
with showing gross unfairness to Italian residents.
The possible designs of Germany in North Africa also
induced the Italian Government to take advantage of
the first opportunity for an offensive step.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>The Turks, foreseeing danger, sent war stores and
munitions to Tripoli, and on September 29, 1911, the
Italians, with their fleet ready and their troops embarked,
declared war.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>On September 30th, Tripoli was blockaded and
occupied by the Italians on October 5th; Benghazi fell
on October 20th. In spite of the publication of a decree
annexing Tripoli as a province of Italy, the advance
of the invaders was kept in check. Austria refused
to allow operations in the Adriatic. Russia would
not permit the blockade of the Dardanelles. Fighting
continued with indeterminate results and in a desultory
manner until a treaty of peace was finally signed at
Ouchy on October 15, 1912.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<h3>Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Lausanne</i>, October 15, 1912, Turkish
forces were withdrawn from Tripoli and Cyrenaica,
the Italians promised to withdraw from the occupied
islands of the Ægean, and a commercial agreement
was concluded between the two countries. There was
no recognition by the Turkish Government of Italian
sovereignty in Tripoli. It was enough for Italy that
her sovereignty was recognized by the Powers. This
was done, France delaying her assent until Italy surrendered
certain privileges in Morocco.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Italy’s aggressive action was prompted by a desire
not to be left behind in the competition for territorial
acquisitions in Africa.</p>

<h2 id="FIRST_BALKAN_WAR">FIRST BALKAN WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1912–1913</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>Even after the deposition of the Sultan, Abdul Hamid,
and the triumph of the Young Turks in the revolution
of 1908 the misgovernment of Turkey did not cease,
more especially in Macedonia, where the European
Powers had entirely failed to secure any reforms, but
produced an intolerable situation in the Balkan Peninsula.
Despairing of the successful intervention of
the Powers the Balkan States determined to take
matters into their own hands. For the first time an
alliance was formed between Greece, Bulgaria, and
Serbia for the purpose of destroying the Turkish Empire
in Europe.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>In September 1912 the Powers, through Austria,
Hungary, and Russia strongly deprecated the outbreak
of war. The Allies simultaneously handed in to the
Turkish Government an Ultimatum demanding certain
specified reforms. No reply was sent. The Turks
underestimated the strength of their opponents, and
hoped to detach Greece. War broke out October 17th.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Turkish forces were completely overwhelmed.
They were defeated by the Serbians at Kumanovo,
October 24, 1912, and Uskub was occupied: the Greeks
drove the enemy north and occupied Salonika: and
the Bulgarians defeated the Ottoman army at Lule
Burgas, October 31st, and advanced to Chatalja. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
an armistice and an abortive attempt of the Powers
to secure peace, the war broke out again. Adrianople
fell March 26, 1913, and the Turks submitted.</p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of London</i> Bulgaria was given a frontier
from Enos on the Mediterranean to Midia on the Black
Sea. The future of Albania was to be decided by the
Allies and Turkey ceded the island of Crete to Greece.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Serious disputes as to the disposal of the spoils won
from Turkey led immediately to the outbreak of war
among the Allies.</p>

<h2 id="SECOND_BALKAN_WAR">SECOND BALKAN WAR<br />

<span class="subhead">1913</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Belligerents:</h3>

<p class="bellig">
Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Roumania.<br />
Bulgaria.<br />
Turkey.
</p>

<h3>Cause:</h3>

<p>In February 1912 a treaty was concluded between
Bulgaria and Serbia, whereby it was agreed that North-west
Macedonia should go to Serbia, another part to
Bulgaria, and the zone lying between these two should
be submitted to the arbitration of the Czar. In
December 1912, in the First Balkan War, Austria
protested against the occupation by Serbia of Durazzo
on the Adriatic, and of Scutari by Montenegro. Serbia
declared that Bulgaria did not adequately support
her in resisting the Austrian demand, felt impelled to
claim more territory in Macedonia, and refused to carry
out the provisions of the treaty with Bulgaria. Serbia
was ready to arbitrate. Russia was inclined to support
the Serbian claim. Bulgaria hesitated.</p>

<h3>Occasion:</h3>

<p>While the dispute was still in the balance the aggressive
party in Bulgaria got the upper hand, and war
was declared against Serbia and Greece in June 24,
1913, only a few months after the cessation of hostilities
in the First Balkan War.</p>

<h3>Course of the War:</h3>

<p>The Bulgarians found themselves invaded on four
frontiers. While they were being driven back by
Serbia and Greece, the Turks repudiated the Treaty
of London and retook Adrianople, and Roumania
advanced from the north and without striking a blow
annexed a large slice of territory in the Dobrudja.
Bulgaria was obliged to yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<h3>Political Result:</h3>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Bukarest</i>, August 10, 1913, Serbia
acquired a large district of South-east Macedonia,
Greece obtained Kavalla, and Roumania was given
possession of the territory her troops had occupied.</p>

<p>By the <i>Treaty of Constantinople</i>, August 1913,
Bulgaria ceded back to Turkey more than half of the
territory won in the previous war, including Adrianople.</p>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<p>Bulgaria being again restricted in territory felt she
had been betrayed by the Powers, who did nothing
to enforce the engagements of the Treaty of London.
Her rivals, Serbia and Greece, gained at her expense.
On the other hand, Bulgarian responsibility for the
outbreak of the second war was undoubted.</p>

<p>The European Powers, by acting together, prevented
the Balkan conflict from spreading into a European
War. But the Treaty of Bukarest was no settlement,
and was a signal exposure of their inability to solve
the Balkan problem, which was destined to be the
spark for a world-wide conflagration.</p>

Signed by Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia,
France at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p class="in">France gave up certain fortresses on the frontier
but retained Alsace-Lorraine. Payment of 700 million
francs was exacted from France. The greater part
of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw fell to Russia, Posen
to Prussia, and Cracow became a republic. Prussia
got back nearly all her old possessions, and there
was a reconstruction of German States under a Confederation.
Holland, Belgium, and Luxemburg were
established as an independent kingdom under the
House of Orange: Switzerland was extended and her
integrity guaranteed: Sardinia obtained Genoa and
other territory: Austria received an extension of
territory in North Italy and on the coast of the Adriatic,

be paid over by Great Britain as indemnity.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Triple Alliance</i> in 1882 was the result of Italy joining
the alliance between Germany and Austria, which had
grown out of the support given to Austria as against
Russia at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Italy having
become estranged from France after the occupation
of Tunis in 1881. The Triple Alliance was renewed
for five years in 1887 and in 1891, and again in 1902
it was extended for a term of twelve years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Berlin Act.</i> The outcome of the Conference of Berlin,
1884–5, at which fourteen Powers were represented.
The respective spheres of influence of the European
Powers in Africa were delimited. The neutrality of
the Congo Free State was recognized, and it was established
as an independent State under the sovereignty
of the King of the Belgians. An area was marked
out in which there should be free trade, which should
be excluded from effects of disputes between the signatory
Powers, and be placed under the rule of neutrality.</p>

<p class="in">The latter stipulation has, however, not been carried
out.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Suez Canal Convention</i> signed by nine Powers at Constantinople,
October 29, 1888. Lesseps obtained the
preliminary concession for the construction of the Canal
in 1856. The Canal was opened in 1869. Disraeli
bought four million pounds’ worth of shares from the
Khedive on behalf of the British Government in 1875.
The Convention ensured that the Canal should always
be open to vessels of commerce and war without distinction
of flag. Great Britain signed with a reservation,
but in the Anglo-French agreement of 1904
declared her adherence to the Convention and agreed
to its being put into force.</p></blockquote>

the Canal was thereby abrogated.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Anglo-Japanese Alliance.</i> Treaties signed in London
January 30, 1902, and August 12, 1905. The integrity
and independence of China was recognized. If either
Great Britain or Japan should be attacked and involved
in a war with two Powers, they engaged mutually to
assist one another. The aim of the alliance was officially
defined as “the consolidation and maintenance of
general peace in the regions of Eastern Asia and of
India.” In 1911 the treaty was revised, a clause
stipulating that there was no obligation to go to war
with a Power with whom a treaty of arbitration was in
force. This removed the danger of Great Britain being
involved in a war between Japan and the United States.</p></blockquote>

majorities to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the
dispute. The delimitation of the frontier was carried
out by a mixed commission, and to commemorate the
treaty an immense statue of Christ was erected on a

was concluded in October of the same year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
with regard to Morocco. To both these treaties secret
clauses were attached which amounted virtually to the
prospective partition of Morocco by France and Spain.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Agreement of Karlstadt</i>, September 23, 1905.</p>

<p class="in">The Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved,
and Norway recognized as an independent
kingdom.</p>

<p class="in">The movement in favour of separation had grown
rapidly from 1899. It was resisted by the King of
Sweden. A plebiscite in Norway declared in favour
of it, and agreement was reached without any armed
conflict.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Algeciras Act</i>, April 7, 1906, agreed to by thirteen
Powers, was based on the sovereignty, independence,
integrity, and economic liberty of Morocco. The provisions
concerned the organization of police, regulation
of taxation, customs, etc. This Act was disregarded
by France in 1911, when a French force was sent to
Fez and occupied the country.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Anglo-Russian Convention</i>, September 23, 1907.</p>

<p class="in">Persia was divided so as to give Great Britain and
Russia spheres of influence with a neutral zone between.
(Persia was not a party to the treaty.) An
agreement was come to with regard to Afghanistan
and Thibet, settling all points where dispute might
arise.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty</i>, April 4, 1908.</p>

<p class="in">By this Treaty differences between Great Britain
and the United States which do not affect the vital
interests, independence, or honour of either country,
or which do not concern the interests of third parties
are referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration
at the Hague.</p></blockquote>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
